Purpose: Track quantitative outcomes that prove reliability, performance, cost, and security.

## What goes here
- Dashboards exports, CSVs, and screenshots for SLOs, alerts, DR timers, FinOps savings, security scores.

## Required artifacts
- `sre/` (SLOs, error budgets, alert rates)
- `finops/` (cost baselines, optimization diffs, ≥20% savings proof)
- `dr/` (RTO timers, failover timings <15m)
- `security/` (Defender score ≥85%) 

## Done criteria
- Each repo links to at least one metric screenshot and its source data.
