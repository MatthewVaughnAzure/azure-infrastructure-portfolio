# Blogs

Purpose: Publish 2+ technical blogs that showcase the portfolio outcomes and thinking.

## What goes here
- Drafts and final posts for your blog/LinkedIn/dev.to/Medium.
- Images/diagrams used in posts.

## Required artifacts
- `YYYY-MM-DD-title/` per post containing:
  - `draft.md` (full post)
  - `images/` (diagrams, screenshots)
  - `publish-links.md` (URLs where published)
  - `social-snippets.md` (2–3 short blurbs for sharing)

## Guidance
- Tie each post to a real repo artifact (CI pipeline, KQL, DR<15m, FinOps savings).
- End with a short “Receipts” section linking to your repo.

## Done criteria (per post)
- Published link + repo cross‑links + 1 diagram/screenshot minimum.
